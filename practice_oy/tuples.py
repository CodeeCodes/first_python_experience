# tuples are structures that can hold different information

# tuples in brackets instead of square brackets like an array

coordinates = [(4, 5), (2, 1)]
coordinates_2 = (10, 12)
print (coordinates[1], coordinates[0])
print (coordinates_2[1], coordinates_2[0])

# tuples are immutable (can not be changed)!
